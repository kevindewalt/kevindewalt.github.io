# Discovering opportunities for large-language models and generative AI for legal, compliance, risk, and surveillance functions


## A handbook for analytics and innovation leaders at financial institutions


[TOC]



# 


# Discover business opportunities with large-language models


## Automation in legal, compliance, risk, and surveillance is now possible

Historically, most back-office business processes at financial services institutions have not been automated due to the inability of computers to effectively process unstructured data such as emails, PDFs, and images. Consequently, most legal, compliance, risk, and surveillance (LCRS) functions have relied on tedious, human-driven processes supported by basic IT workflows.

This obstacle has now been overcome. Business applications based on large-language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT can perform basic reasoning tasks and process unstructured data.


## Identifying the best opportunities remains challenging

Unfortunately, pinpointing the most advantageous opportunities for leveraging LLMs in LCRS business functions is not an easy task. Business customers (e.g., lawyers, compliance officers, risk managers) and technologists often employ incompatible language when discussing potential projects.

For instance, a compliance officer with deep expertise in regulation and policy may not understand how natural-language processing (NLP) capabilities, such as entity extraction and semantic search, are relevant to their work.

In our experience, most business customers only recognize opportunities for innovative technology when they see relevant examples based on their data.


## About this handbook

This handbook is designed for analytics leaders at financial services companies tasked with bringing innovative solutions to LCRS business problems. We have created use case examples based on real business problems and solutions we have deployed at the world's largest regulators and financial services companies.

These examples are generated using publicly available data and OpenAI's ChatGPT 4.0 model. We provide the prompts in the Appendix, so you can modify and run them yourself on this or other models.


## Discovering business opportunities for LLMs

Use these examples as conversation starters with your constituents. Each use case starts with a question for spurring conversation. We recommend casual face-to-face conversations where you show them examples and ask whether the solution is relevant to their work. In most cases, they will respond with, _"Not exactly, but can the technology do...?"_ This exchange will initiate the process of winning over skeptical business partners and identifying your best opportunities. You can then use LLMs and prompt engineering to generate more relevant examples and probe for challenges.


## From opportunities to business case

Of course, identifying potential opportunities is only the first step. To build a business case, you will also need to answer numerous other questions, such as:



1. Can we gain access to the data for the solution?
2. Do we have the team to build and support it?
3. Do our policies permit us to use a hosted solution like OpenAI's GPT models, or do we need to develop an internally-managed solution?
4. How can we create generalized capabilities instead of one-off solutions?

Prolego has years of experience addressing these and many other AI questions. Feel free to contact us; we'll be happy to provide some advice during a 30-minute call.


# Seven use cases for large-language models



1. Summarizing rules

_Question: Would you find it helpful if we could automatically summarize rules, proposed rules, or other large documents into a few concise sentences?_

Regulators continuously release proposed and actual rule changes, and managing this constant stream of complex legal content can be overwhelming for compliance organizations. Rules often come with limited summary information, resulting in experts evaluating documents that turn out to be irrelevant to their business operations.

LLMs can help summarize rules or proposed rules, enhancing compliance operational efficiency. Here's an example of condensing a proposed SEC rule into just a few sentences.


### Example

Here is a summary of SEC proposed rule [Electronic Submission of Certain Material Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; Amendments Regarding the FOCUS Report](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2023/33-11176.pdf).



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")




2. Routing rule changes to the appropriate compliance function

_Question: We understand you receive many notifications about proposed rule changes, findings, interpretations, and other information from regulatory bodies that impact compliance and policies. Would it be helpful if we automatically identified the appropriate audience for these notices?_

This example was created using a description of general compliance functions. You can make a more powerful example by modifying the prompts with the actual functions in your institution and use actual regulatory notices. 

Here is the suggested group to review SEC proposed rule [Electronic Submission of Certain Material Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; Amendments Regarding the FOCUS Report](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2023/33-11176.pdf).



<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")




3. Tracing rules to policy documents

_Question: Would it be helpful if we could automatically map rules or rule changes directly to the most relevant parts of our policies?_

We promise you they will say, “of course”! Tracing rules to appropriate locations in polices is an extremely tedious process and inconsistencies between the two create risk. You should also expect your business customers to be extremely skeptical.

In this example we trace a rule to appropriate policy sections using only the table of content of a  Written Supervisory Procedures policy document. In practice a technique called “semantic search” is required to connect rules to the most appropriate sections within every policy document, many of which contain hundreds of pages. 

Developing a solution to automatically trace rules to policies takes several months of engineering work, but the efficiency and risk reduction is so valuable that many firms are developing custom solutions. In time every firm will need this capability to avoid regulatory scrutiny.

In this example we ask the LLM to trace the contents of [FINRA Rule 3320](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/3220) to the most appropriate sections of the Policies at a fictitious company called OrangeInvestors.



<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")




4. `Detecting potential risk and policy loopholes from cryptocurrency

_Question: Would it be useful to have AI automatically review and identify potential policy loopholes that could be exploited by bad actors?_

This is fun exercise—and one that will likely spur conversations about the future of your firm’s risk program. You can use the LLMs to automatically identify potential loopholes in policies. In practice, the technology will be most useful for surfacing potential issues that require additional discussion.

In this scenario, we asked the LLM to identify ways an employee could use cryptocurrency transactions to violate potential policies.



<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")




5. Automatically generating draft reports and correspondence

_Question: Would it be helpful to automatically draft correspondence such as memos, reports, and letters?_

Generating and reviewing correspondence is a tedious, time-consuming task in LCRS functions. It also carries high-risk: an error or mistake in correspondence can expose the firm to litigation or other risks. Managers must often invest significant time reviewing correspondence of new employees to mitigate this risk.

LLMs can generate draft correspondence if the models are trained on the firm’s specific products, services and past correspondence. The results would still require human review, but it can serve as a starting point.

In this example a compliance officer generates a memo to the Chief Compliance Officer at a firm summarizing and SEC investigation: [Two Former Wells Fargo Employees Charged With Insider Trading in Advance of Research Reports Containing Ratings Changes](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2014-221).



<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image5.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")




6. Answering questions about policies

_Question: Do you find that employees don’t read policies? If so, would it be useful to create a chat interface so they could ask questions about what is and isn’t allowed?_

LLMs can do more than chat - they can provide answers to questions and give context. Here is an answer to questions about gifts and behaviors outside the company.



<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")
 



7. Identifying people, places, organizations, and relationships in documents

_Question: Would it be helpful to extract entities (people, places, organizations, etc.) and identify relationships across different documents?_

Surveillance programs often need to track behavior and relationships across a number of different sources, what data scientists call entity extraction and relationship reconciliation. Here is an example of extracting names and relationships for importing into a graph database. \

SEC Proposes to Modernize the Submission of Certain Forms, Filings, and Materials Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2023-58


Washington D.C., March 22, 2023 —
The Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed amendments designed to modernize its information collection and analysis methods by, among other things, proposing that a number of filings be submitted to the Commission electronically on EDGAR using structured data where appropriate.


Under current rules, registrants are required to file or otherwise submit many Exchange Act forms, filings, or other submissions in paper form. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many submissions were made in electronic rather than paper form, which was generally well received. As part of its efforts to modernize the methods by which it collects and analyzes information from registrants, the proposed amendments would require registrants to make these submissions to the Commission electronically.


"We live in a digital age. In 2023, one might think that all filings to the Commission already could be made electronically. That's not yet true," said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. "Today, we have the important opportunity to require electronic filing for nearly all of the remaining paper filings required under the Exchange Act. I believe the proposal, if adopted, would save both registrants and the Commission time and resources."


Specifically, the proposed amendments would require the electronic filing, submission, or posting of certain forms, filings, and other submissions that national securities exchanges, national securities associations, clearing agencies, broker-dealers, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants make with the Commission. The proposed amendments would also make certain amendments regarding the Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single ("FOCUS") Report to harmonize it with other rules, make technical corrections, and provide clarifications. In addition, the proposed amendments would require withdrawal of notices filed in connection with an exception to counting certain dealing transactions toward determining whether a person is a security-based swap dealer in specified circumstances.

## Prompt: Routing rule changes to the appropriate compliance function


```
Below is an SEC proposed rule change. Which compliance function should review this proposed rule change for action?

The Internal Audit Group periodically examines all company practices to ensure that they are adhering to defined internal and external policies, laws and regulations. The Internal Audit Group then reports its findings to management and business unit leaders to ensure that all parties are aware of areas in need of regulatory adjustments.

The Policy Creation Group is responsible for examining and researching risk areas and then drafting corporate governance policies that will mitigate the identified risk areas. They are also responsible for training employees on compliant processes and procedures.

The Policy Enforcement Group sets guidelines to handle issues of non-compliance. They develop standardized, consistent, legally sound protocols to address each possible situation of non-compliance.

The Regulatory Reporting Group defines data collection procedures (related to compliance), then compiles and files reports for management and government institutions. Regulatory reports deal with issues such as environmental friendliness or food/drug safety.

The Risk Management Group evaluates regulatory and non-regulatory risk and formulates responses and plans of action to mitigate and respond to those risks. They prioritize certain risks based on consequences (monetary or other), set risk tolerance levels and create procedures based on the level of risk involved.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2014-221

Washington D.C., Sept. 29, 2014 —
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against two former Wells Fargo employees involved in an alleged scheme to profit by buying or short selling a stock before research analyst reports were published containing a ratings change.

Research analysts typically produce reports with a recommendation or rating of a stock or other security they've reviewed.  When an analyst alters a prior view on the prospects of a security, a new report is issued with a ratings change.  The SEC's Enforcement Division alleges that while Gregory T. Bolan Jr. worked as a research analyst at Wells Fargo, he tipped a trader at the firm, Joseph C. Ruggieri, in advance of several market-moving ratings upgrades or downgrades that he made in certain securities.  The tips enabled Ruggieri to generate more than $117,000 in profits.  

"Instead of abiding by firm policies that specifically prohibited trading ahead of published research, Ruggieri used information obtained from Bolan to make profitable trades in advance of six separate research reports," said Sanjay Wadhwa, Senior Associate Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office.  "The repeated nature of these violations demonstrates an utter disregard for our insider trading laws."

According to the SEC's order instituting a litigated proceeding before an administrative law judge, Bolan also tipped a close friend with nonpublic information about his upcoming ratings changes.  The friend, who is now deceased, generated approximately $10,000 in profits in a personal brokerage account by trading ahead of three ratings changes.

"Bolan gave two traders a sneak preview into his upcoming ratings changes and provided them an unfair and illegal advantage on the rest of the markets," said Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. 

The SEC's Enforcement Division alleges that after receiving Bolan's tips, Ruggieri either purchased the relevant company's stock ahead of Bolan's upgrades or sold the stock short ahead of Bolan's downgrades.  Ruggieri closed his overnight positions in those securities for a profit shortly after Bolan's ratings changes were made public and the stock prices had moved.  From April 2010 to March 2011, Bolan published a total of eight research reports with a ratings change or initiation of coverage with an "outperform" or "underperform" rating.  Ruggieri traded profitably ahead of six of these reports in a manner that did not fit in his typical trading pattern.  Aside from this trading ahead, Ruggieri had only a handful of overnight positions in securities that had been rated within the six months prior to his trading.

Policy:
-----
OrangeInvestors, Inc. has set forth a number of important policies for its employees to adhere to. Employees are not allowed to use the company's name in a way that could imply a connection between OrangeInvestors and their personal activities. Employees must disclose any outside business activities (OBAs) in writing before engaging in them, and the firm will evaluate whether such activities interfere with the employee's responsibilities or could be viewed as an extension of the firm's business. Charitable activities are exempt from this requirement unless the employee receives compensation for their involvement.

Employees are required to adhere to restrictions on gifts and gratuities. Gifts given in relation to the firm's business must not exceed $100 per year per person, excluding reasonable business entertainment where the employee hosts the event. Employees may not solicit or accept gifts from customers or vendors without written approval from Compliance, unless the gift is of nominal value (less than $100) or constitutes customary business lunches, entertainment, or promotional items.

High-pressure sales tactics, such as excessive phone calls or misleading customers about limited supplies or changing prices, are strictly prohibited. Employees of OrangeInvestors are not permitted to provide tax advice to customers, as the firm is not engaged in tax advisory services. Instead, customers should be referred to their personal tax advisers for any tax-related guidance.
